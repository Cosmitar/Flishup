# Experimental tool, built it with Ionic framework.

This application was created as request for an airline pilot to get information of flights after his service.
Since this pilot flies from AEP to COR, only those two airports are available by now on the app.

###Tool's goals:
- offer an origin-destination selection.
- allow user to pick today or tomorrow date.
- request a search of flights for selected options.
- list the flights showing airplane registration, flight number, time and status.
- for a selected flight, show a summary and request a crew members information.

###My goals:
- learn and try out Ionic framework.
- face up a UI with a particular navigation history.
- test Ionic Material styles.
- write a useful piece of code.
- have fun
